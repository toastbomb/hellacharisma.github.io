## Can I donate?
- I don't mind paying for it all myself (costs about $0.50 per 10-man) but if you'd like to chip in you can send money to `@Tucker-Kolpin` on Venmo

## How do I startup the server?
- Create an account at [DatHost](https://dathost.net/)
- Give me (TOAST BOMB) the email address you used for the account so I can give it access
- Once you have access you should be able to click the profile icon in the top right and see `tckolpin@gmail.com` as an option in the resulting dropdown
- Click `tckolpin@gmail.com` and you should go to the server dashboard
- Click `Start`

**Please remember to stop the server when you are done. If you do forget the server will auto shutdown after 30 min of being empty**

## How do I download demos?
